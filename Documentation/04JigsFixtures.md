# Jigs / Fixtures 

## Introduction

A fundamental part of every manufacturing process, jigs and fixtures allow the placement of parts in specific orientations or relative to another part for fixture. 

* Define Jig
* Define Fixture

They allow for the securing of parts and to guide tools during production. In doing so,  they allow the production of parts to ensure reliability and accuracy, such as having an inset on a block to ensure that the part in the correct orientation and is securely held during assembly.

* In addition, they can be used f0r interchangeability, as they can be replaced to fit another part with relative ease
* In a more complex design, the accuracy and reliability of a jig is highly important

jigs achieve this by doing the following:

* locating points for the part
  * having inserts and/or pads for certain locations and/or positions
* guaranteeing mechanically the position and/or orientation of a part
  * essentially act as a clamping part
  * may include some minor automation components
* reducing idle time through removing the need for clamping and/or positioning
* are made of materials that tend to resist wear (but are therefore expensive)
* are ideally replacable
* can be designed to accomodate for robot manipulation



Jigs need to design with the additional in mind:

SAFETY

* safety, as parts that fly out of a jig can cause problems
* jigs breaking, so ensuring that they don't  fly away and cause problems
* jigs wearing down over time, leading to faulty products and/or robots putting things that shouldnt go in the wrong place
* the safety of the operator should be included
* sharp corners should be avoided

DESIGN

* should factor in the design process that is required of the part
* the capacity of the jig
* the location and the even distribution of forces -- where do they go?
* should be foolproofed in a way that allows for minor inperfects 
* should consider loading and unloading of parts

**Material considerations**

* the requirements for the jig is important and therefore the following things should be considered
  * should be easily machined or be designed for manufacture themselves
  * high hardness and durability to resist damage
  * should ideally not shrink or be affected by temperature
  * should consider metal-to-metal contact, so parts that contact should be considered to include materials such as nylon or felt

## Requirements

using moscow

### Task Description

the task required of the jig depends on the overview of the assembly process, which was detailed in the previous section.

the sequence is as follows

1. the plate is moved from the dispenser and placed on the jig
2. [concurrent] the washers should be put into place on the jig
3. [concurrent] the bracket should be put into place on the jig
4. the rivets should be put into place and ideally fastened
5. the entire assembly is then moved away

> we can probably use a gantt chart to show the above, or some sort of seq diagram

### Requirements Breakdown

* should be able to hold the plate down securely
* must contain a location to mount the plate
* should have some sort of placement and/or mechanism to place the bracket into place
* should have some sort of mechanism to place washers into place
* should require relatively little intervention from the robot
* must be secured down
* must be machineable/manufacturable
* should not require human/operator intervention
* should be replaceable
* would like to be as safe as possible
* would like to be as modular as possible, which allows for changing of broken parts if necessary
* would like to contain as few moving parts if possible (notably, NO conveyor belts)

## Research

* the standard sizes of rivets
* material selection
* safety, how to make the robot cell safe (mostly keeping things inside the cage)

## Selection

## Final Design

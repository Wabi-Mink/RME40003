# Grippers

Multiple design approaches are provided and the justifications are given for the finalised design

gripper can grip each component with optional additional capability

fully serves the purpose

Everything in this document should be dot pointed

### Introduction

* Where robots are just computer controlled machines, they need the ability to both move to the specified location and perform an action
* this is done through
* grippers, or otherwise end effectors, are the method in which a robot can perform useful work both on and around the work cell. 
* common tasks include
* examples of grippers include
* given that the actual task of the robot is carried out by the gripper, it is important to design and/or select the gripper most suited for the specific task.

There are two kinds of end-effectors

* tools
* grippers

### Requirements

the requirements we'll used will be based on our component design, with the tri-star system.

again, we'll be using MoSCoW here to simplify the design process.

#### Task Description

in this case, the goal would be to maniuplte the plates effectively to place them from point A to point B. The robot arm will be used to move the plate from the dispenser, in the right position or not, into the riveting station. the arm will then need to pick up rivets and rivet the piece into place. Given that the jig will handle the washers, the arm may also be required to place the jig and/or the the washers into place

**Sequence**

The gripper picks up the plate from the dispenser and places the jig into place

The gripper should ideally align the plate somehow

the gripper then picks up rivets and rivets them into place

the gripper then picks up the completed ass'y and puts it away

#### Requirements Breakdown

MOSCOW

* Must be able to pick up the plate
* Should align the plate
* Must be able to pick up and rivet the plate
* Must be able to pick up the plate afterward
* Would like to have to hold the plate in a stable manner
* Would like it to be able to pick up the washer magazines and/or the clamping plates



### Ideations

(this one didnt have that many requirements nor ideations, yay)

### Research

* Rivet sizes

* rivet feeding mechanisms
* mechanisms as a whole

### Selection

### Final Design

The final design was selected because:

* the tri grip is strong 

* the design allows for a cam in the centre

* the design has multiple repeating parts and is designed to be taken apart easily and mechanically simple

* the tool can conpensate for the inability to clasp the  washer mag easily

* the tool can pick up the part even if there are things in the way

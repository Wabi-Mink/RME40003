## Important Notes

Due 11 September (Mid Semester Break Friday)

Challenge is modular parts: convenient system maintenance, lower replacement cost, and flexible production. Students are encouraged to design a robot based manufacturing cell with modular design.

* Does this mean that the part is designed to be modular?
* Or the robot cell/layout is modular?



## Takeaways from Rubric

### Design

* Multiple design approaches are taken for:
  * Each redesigned **component**, justifications and provided for final design.
  * Each redesigned **fixture**, again, justifications.
  * Each **gripper**
  * Each **storage**, **feeder**, and **orientation devices**
* Multiple robots are considered and justifications provided.

### Report

#### Flowchart

* Includes multiple inputs from sensors
* Has some form of subprogram to ensure smooth operation
* A path planning routine incorporated
* Flowchart is comprehensive

#### Dimensioned Layout of Manufacturing Cell

* Dimensioned Layout providing location of robot and devices clearly marked
* Layout has minimal space redundancy
* Locations are justified to facilitate the assembly process
* Planning for the robot and path considered, waypoints are marked for each action (gripping, traversing...)

#### Design of Safety

* Safety system ensures all devices are capable of 'full work' safety
* Unique and interesting safety system ensures both smooth robot operation and work safety.

#### Report Presentation and Comprehension

* Report has structure with cover sheet, introduction and conclusion
* Report is presented comprehensively with good and consistent formatting
* Report is well formatted with captions, table of figures, table of contents
